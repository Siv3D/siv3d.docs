## 2. Siv3D Implementation Meetups
These are gatherings where Siv3D developers and users come together to ask questions and consult about programming, create documentation and tests, propose, discuss, and implement new features, and create things with Siv3D. They are held several times a year.

There are both offline and online events. Online events are held within the Siv3D Discord server.

### Comments from Implementation Meetup Participants

<blockquote>This was my first participation and as a beginner I was very anxious, but they explained everything clearly to any questions and things I didn't understand. I was also able to experience creating and completing a game from scratch in just 3 hours, making it a very meaningful time</blockquote>  

<blockquote>It was my first participation in an OpenSiv3D implementation meetup in about a year, so I spent time leisurely creating sample code while being introduced to new features. The script functionality that doesn't require compilation is powerful, and being able to see actual game creation through ultra-high-speed game development was very educational.</blockquote>

## 3. Siv3D Study Sessions
These are events to learn game and application development with Siv3D while experiencing programming that utilizes sound, images, and AI with Siv3D. They are also opportunities to directly share opinions and ask questions with the Siv3D developer.
