# Community

## 1. Siv3D Discord Server
This is a group chat for Siv3D users. It has dedicated channels for various purposes, allowing you to discuss Siv3D, ask questions, and showcase your work. There are also channels for those interested in the development of the Siv3D engine itself, where we share progress updates and collaborate on new features.

While many conversations are in Japanese, we warmly welcome posts and questions in English. Many of our Japanese members use translation tools, so don't let the language barrier stop you from joining the conversation!

## 2. Siv3D Implementation Meetups
These are gatherings for Siv3D developers and users to ask questions about programming, create documentation and tests, propose and implement new features, or just build things with Siv3D. They are held several times a year.

Meetups can be either offline or online. Online meetups are held on the Siv3D Discord server.

### Comments from Implementation Meetup Participants

> This was my first time participating, and as a beginner, I was very anxious. However, they clearly explained everything I didn't understand and answered all my questions. I also had the valuable experience of creating and completing a game from scratch in just three hours. It was a very meaningful time.

> It had been about a year since I last participated in an OpenSiv3D implementation meetup. I spent my time leisurely creating sample code while learning about new features. The script functionality, which doesn't require compilation, is powerful. Seeing a game being made in real-time with this ultra-high-speed development was very educational.

## 3. Siv3D Study Sessions
These are events where you can learn game and app development by programming with sound, images, and AI in Siv3D. They are also a great opportunity to share your opinions and ask questions directly to the Siv3D developer.

We also offer [free on-site Siv3D study sessions for schools and local communities :material-open-in-new:](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eiz3ohkqdt70w1g/Siv3D%20%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8B%89%E5%BC%B7%E4%BC%9A%E3%81%AE%E6%A1%88%E5%86%85.pdf?dl=0){:target="_blank"}. Please contact us via Discord, DM, or email for more information.

## 4. OpenSiv3D Challenge / Internship
In this event, you choose from several challenge tasks for creating new Siv3D features, join a dedicated channel on the Siv3D user community Discord, and work towards completing the implementation, either by collaborating or competing with other members. You can receive technical support, including priority code reviews and implementation advice.
