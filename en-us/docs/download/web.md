# Getting Started with Siv3D Programming for Web
Siv3D for web browsers is provided unofficially. Since the web version has some limitations and considerations, it is **targeted at intermediate users and above who are familiar with using Siv3D**. If you encounter any problems while using it, please ask questions in the `#web` channel of the Siv3D Discord server.

## 1. Development Environment Setup

### 1.1 Common Preparation
- Please refer to [OpenSiv3D for Web :material-open-in-new:](https://siv3d.kamenokosoft.com/docs/ja/){:target="_blank"}.
	- For Visual Studio 2022, you need to download and install a total of 3 software packages.

!!! info "Getting the Latest Version by Community Contributors"
	While the above provides an SDK equivalent to Siv3D v0.6.6, an SDK with improved compliance to newer versions of Siv3D has been developed and provided by community contributors. Among the software introduced in the above [OpenSiv3D for Web installation instructions :material-open-in-new:](https://siv3d.kamenokosoft.com/docs/ja/){:target="_blank"}, please replace the Siv3D SDK with the SDK that can be downloaded from the link below.

## 2. Building Web Version Projects
- Building web version Siv3D takes several times longer than regular Siv3D. It is recommended to do regular development with normal Siv3D and perform web version compatibility checks as needed.
- In Visual Studio, red underlines and error messages may appear in the editor even for correct code.
- In Visual Studio, you can build and run with the "â–¶" button, but if Google Chrome is not installed, execution may not occur after the build is complete.
- The generated `.html` cannot be executed by double-clicking in a local environment. Start it via the debugger or use the VS Code extension [Live Preview :material-open-in-new:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server){:target="_blank"}.


## 3. Publishing Programs
- Upload all 4 files (`.html`, `.js`, `.data`, `.wasm`) finally generated by the build to a web server.
	- Using free web services like GitHub Pages is convenient.
- You can change the web page title by manually editing the `<title>` tag in the `.html`.
- The web version build includes all of `resource/engine/` and `example/` in the final generated files by default, making the file size large at tens of MB even for Release builds. When publishing these on the web, users who access your site will take time to download the files, so when actually publishing applications, please **exclude unnecessary bundled files** (Reference: [Tutorial 60. Publishing Apps](../tutorial3/release.md)).
- In the Emscripten linker settings, you can further reduce the output file size of the web version by removing libraries that the program doesn't use (e.g., `Siv3DScript`, `opencv_objdetect`, `opencv_photo`, `turbojpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `opusfile`, `opus`, `tiff`) from "Additional Dependencies".
- In the most compact case, the file size can be under a few MB.

### Configuration Examples in Visual Studio
#### Specifying Bundled Folders
- `$(ProjectDir)\folder_name@/folder_name`
	- For example, to bundle an `asset` folder, specify `$(ProjectDir)\asset@/asset`.
	- To not bundle the `example` folder, remove `$(ProjectDir)\example@/example`.

#### Removing Dependency Files
- Remove libraries that the program doesn't use from here.

## 4. Web Version Support
Although web version Siv3D is unofficial, we accept questions and reports in the `#web` channel of the Siv3D Discord server.
