## 7. Contact / Q & A
- Contact with organizers and technical questions are handled on the Siv3D Discord server.
- For privacy-related matters only, consultation via email (Siv3D representative Suzuki) `reputeless@gmail.com` or Discord DM is also possible.

??? question "About Team Participation"
	**Q: When participating as a team, do all team members need to register individually on Connpass?**

	Registration is recommended. While it's possible not to register, it becomes inconvenient as you won't receive important notifications or evaluation comment sheets.

??? question "Some Team Members Cannot Attend Certain Events"
	**Q: Some team members have difficulty attending the opening ceremony and midterm presentation. Is full team attendance required for the opening ceremony and midterm presentation?**

	For teams, one representative attending each of the opening ceremony, midterm presentation, and work presentation is sufficient. However, attending as much as possible will deepen understanding of the theme and event purpose. Please share information thoroughly among members.

??? question "Cannot Attend Midterm Presentation"
	**Q: I have classes on the day of the midterm presentation and it's difficult to attend. Is this a problem?**

	If you don't present at the midterm presentation, feedback at the midterm point will be based only on your work introduction page. The midterm presentation is mainly for improving second-half work and exchanging opinions, so not participating will reduce the feedback you receive but won't directly affect final results like awards.

??? question "Receiving Event Notifications from BANDAI NAMCO Studios"
	**Q: Despite selecting "Do not receive notifications" during registration, I'm receiving event information via Connpass.**

	Due to Connpass service specifications, when you participate in an event, you automatically join the event organizer's "group." After that, notifications may be sent when the event organizer creates new events on Connpass. To stop notifications, change the email notification settings for the Connpass "group" or leave the group. The "Do not receive notifications" survey item is different from Connpass notifications.

??? question "Changing 'Do Not Receive Notifications' Setting"
	**Q: I answered about "employment-related notifications" in the registration survey, but I want to change my answer.**

	Since we removed the Connpass event participation deadline, you can temporarily cancel event participation and re-register with the same account to change survey answers without leaving a cancellation history on Connpass. Email addresses for prize delivery can be changed using the same method.

## 9. Executable File (Work) Submission Method
General information about creating executable files in Siv3D is explained in [Zenn Siv3D Tutorial 41 | App Publishing :material-open-in-new:](https://zenn.dev/reputeless/books/siv3d-documentation/viewer/tutorial-release){:target="_blank"}. This section summarizes basic content for game jam participants.

### 9.1 Creating Executable Files
Each time you build Siv3D, an executable file (`ProjectName.exe`) is output to the `App` folder. If your program doesn't explicitly load external files (`example/windmill.png`, `„Çø„Ç§„Éà„É´ÁîªÂÉè.png`, `MyBGM.mp3`, etc.), submitting just that executable file alone will make your work run. If you're loading external files, you'll need to submit the executable file along with all those external files.

Siv3D's standard emoji, icons, and standard fonts (fonts without specified file paths) are automatically embedded in the executable file, so no file bundling is required. As an exception, on Windows, if you write `GlobalAudio::BusSetPitchShiftFilter()` in your code, please bundle the `dll` folder. Also, contents of the `example` folder are not embedded.

Executable files can be built in two ways: Debug build and Release build. Debug builds generate extra debugging information and slow code, which can reduce game frame rates. Be sure to submit executable files built with Release build. Debug build programs display `Debug Build` in the window title.


### 9.2 External File Placement
If your program loads external files, place files at positions relative to the executable file and bundle them. Here's an example of the final submission directory structure when the executable file is `game.exe`.

#### Example 1

```cpp
void Main()
{
	// No external file loading
}
```
```txt
my_game/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ game.exe
```

#### Example 2

```cpp
void Main()
{
	Texture texture{ U"example/windmill.png" };
}
```
```txt
my_game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.exe
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ windmill.png
```

#### Example 3
```cpp
void Main()
{
	Texture texture{ U"asset/title.png" };
	Audio audio{ U"asset/bgm.mp3" };
}
```
```txt
my_game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.exe
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ asset/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ title.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bgm.mp3
```

#### Example 4
```cpp
void Main()
{
	INI texture{ U"config.ini" };
	JSON json = JSON::Load(U"save.json");
}
```
```txt
my_game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.exe
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ini
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ save.json
```

### 9.3 File Embedding (For Those Familiar with Siv3D)
You can embed image and audio files used in your work into the executable file. For details, see [Tutorial 30 | Resource File Embedding :material-open-in-new:](https://zenn.dev/reputeless/books/siv3d-documentation/viewer/tutorial-resource){:target="_blank"}.


### 9.4 Reducing Executable File Size (For Those Familiar with Siv3D)
Executable file size can be reduced by removing embedded files for unused Siv3D features. For details, see section 41.10 of [Zenn Siv3D Tutorial 41 | App Publishing :material-open-in-new:](https://zenn.dev/reputeless/books/siv3d-documentation/viewer/tutorial-release){:target="_blank"}. Be careful during this process, as accidentally deleting necessary files can cause programs to malfunction or fonts not to display.

For web versions, there are different file size reduction methods. Check the [Web Version Usage Guide](../download/web.md){:target="_blank"} or consult on the Siv3D Discord server.


### 9.5 Submitting Complete File Set
Please submit one ZIP file compressed with all files necessary for game execution. There are two submission methods in the work registration form:

1. Upload the ZIP file to online storage like Google Drive or Dropbox with public settings and submit the download URL.
2. Upload the ZIP file directly from the form.


## 10. Source File Submission Method
Siv3D projects contain many files. For source file submission, you can get by with submitting only minimal files. The recommended approach is to publish only `Main.cpp` and files you added or modified to Gist or a GitHub repository and submit that URL.

#### A. When Complete with One Source Code (Publish with GitHub Gist)

```txt title="Directory Structure Example"
ProjectDirectory/
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.cpp
```

[Method A Sample :material-open-in-new:](https://gist.github.com/Reputeless/7c10a22d080468e239183b16fb670e34){:target="_blank" .md-button } 

If you completed your game using only Siv3D's bundled fonts, emoji, and icons with just one source file `Main.cpp`, the simplest approach is to publish only `Main.cpp` on [GitHub Gist](../tools/gist.md){:target="_blank"}. GitHub Gist can include multiple files. Add `README.md` as needed to write explanations.


#### B. When Consisting of Multiple Source Codes (Same Directory) (Publish with GitHub Gist)

```txt title="Directory Structure Example"
ProjectDirectory/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Common.hpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title.hpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.hpp
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.cpp
```

[Method B Sample :material-open-in-new:](https://gist.github.com/Reputeless/9fdae7c44013e25f290b255dcc8701e7){:target="_blank" .md-button } 

If you completed your game using only Siv3D's bundled fonts, emoji, and icons with multiple source files (.cpp / .hpp) in the same directory, the simplest approach is to publish those source files (.cpp / .hpp) on [GitHub Gist](../tools/gist.md){:target="_blank"}. GitHub Gist can include multiple files. Add `README.md` as needed to write explanations. If there are many files, you can also choose method C.


#### C. When Consisting of Multiple Hierarchical Source Codes (Publish with GitHub Repository)

```txt title="Directory Structure Example"
ProjectDirectory/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Common.hpp
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title/
‚îÇ	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title.hpp
‚îÇ	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Title.cpp
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Game/
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.hpp
	‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.cpp
```

[Method C Sample :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/Reputeless/Sample_Siv3D_Project_1){:target="_blank" .md-button } 

If you completed your game using only Siv3D's bundled fonts, emoji, and icons with multiple source files (.cpp / .hpp) in hierarchical directories, publishing source files (.cpp / .hpp) in a GitHub repository is optimal. Add `README.md` as needed to write explanations.

Since Siv3D users can easily create projects, you don't need to publish project files (.sln / .xcodeproj / .vcxproj).


#### D. When Using External Files Like Images, Audio, Text (Publish with GitHub Repository)

```txt title="Directory Structure Example"
ProjectDirectory/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Common.hpp
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Title.hpp
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Title.cpp
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.hpp
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.cpp
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asset/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.png
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ini
```

[Method D Sample :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/Reputeless/Sample_Siv3D_Project_2){:target="_blank" .md-button } 

When you place external files like images, audio, and text in the App folder, publishing source files (.cpp / .hpp) and the `App` folder differences (files you added) in a GitHub repository is optimal. Add `README.md` as needed to write explanations.


#### E. For More Complex Cases (Publish with GitHub Repository)
For more complex cases, please publish source files and related files in a GitHub repository to the extent possible. Use the [.gitignore file for Siv3D projects](../tools/gitignore.md){:target="_blank"} as needed.


#### F. Direct Upload
If you don't have a GitHub account or don't understand the above methods, you can directly upload a ZIP file containing all source code.
