## 4. Developing New Features

### 4.1 Developing Libraries for Siv3D
- Please consult through Siv3D Discord or OpenSiv3D implementation meetups. We provide technical support including implementation policies.
- Develop libraries in a form that Siv3D users can use and publish them in GitHub repositories. If there is sufficient demand and high code quality, we will begin work to incorporate them into official Siv3D features.

#### Examples of Issues for Siv3D library development
- [https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/482 :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/482){:target="_blank"}
- [https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/734 :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/734){:target="_blank"}


### 4.2 Improving Siv3D Code
- Please consult through Siv3D Discord or OpenSiv3D implementation meetups. We provide technical support including implementation policies.


### 4.3 Adding New Features to Siv3D
- Please consult through Siv3D Discord or OpenSiv3D implementation meetups. We provide technical support including implementation policies.
- OpenSiv3D Challenge provides new feature implementation tasks.


## 5. Providing Sample Assets for Siv3D
You can contribute to Siv3D by providing image and audio materials that users can freely use in Siv3D projects. Please consult through Siv3D Discord or OpenSiv3D implementation meetups.

#### Examples of Issues for providing sample assets
- Pixel art: [https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/570 :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/570){:target="_blank"}
- 3D models: [https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/621 :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/Siv3D/OpenSiv3D/issues/621){:target="_blank"}


## 6. Developing Samples and Documentation
- We are recruiting writers for Siv3D samples and documentation. Please consult through Siv3D Discord or OpenSiv3D implementation meetups.
- You can also create and publish your own sample collections using [Cosense](../tools/cosense.md){:target="_blank"}.



## 7. Benefits of Participating in Development
Siv3D aims to maintain and provide a convenient and high-quality framework while advancing open source development with many people. At the same time, we support young people in their teens and twenties to engage in open source software (OSS) activities.

In Siv3D, to help developers who contribute new features and code fixes build a track record of OSS activities, we merge features through Pull Requests from proposers. This ensures that the proposer's achievements are recorded in the commit history of Siv3D's GitHub repository. We also recommend using GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature proposals.

Those who have committed to the Siv3D main body and documentation repositories, as well as those who have made notable contributions, will be invited to become [Siv3D Organization members :material-open-in-new:](https://github.com/orgs/Siv3D/people){:target="_blank"} (the invitation will be sent to the email address registered with GitHub). By accepting the invitation and changing your display setting to "Public" on the above page, the Siv3D icon will be displayed on your GitHub profile page (if the setting remains "Private", the icon will only be visible to yourself and other members).
