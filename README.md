# Siv3D documentation source files

The published website is avilable at https://siv3d.github.io/

## Building the documentation source files
Install the `mkdocs-material` packages using pip:
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```
In the directory where `mkdocs.yml` file resides, build the documentation:
```
mkdocs build
```
This will create a new directory, named `siv3d.github.io`.
